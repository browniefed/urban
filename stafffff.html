							<div id="text">
								<p>Meredith Moore</p>
								<p>Meredith originally went to Esthetics school to work in skin care, but she soon discovered that the world needed more friendly, efficient Waxxers to make the world feel better! This funny lady gets her goofy sense of humor from growing up on a steady diet of Benny Hill and Monty Python mixed in with some WWII History Channel programs. Meredith is a wine and fragrance enthusiast, and she collects funny printed leggings. In her spare time she snuggles with her incredibly bright mini Aussie names Angus. Meredith makes short work of putting even the most nervous guest at ease with her self deprecating wit and love of all things hilarious.</p>

								<p>Landis loves an adventure. At the top of her bucket list is a trip to New Orleans with all her friends. Until then, she has great memories of traveling to Munich for Oktoberfest and sunny road trips to the desert in Southern California with her boyfriend, Ryan. They moved up to Portland and brought along a Pekingnese mix love child, Disco and 2 overweight step kitties gizmo and ginger. She has her BA in Business Admin, but later decided her calling was to be an esthetician to help people feel beautiful and confident in their own skin!</p>

								<p>Alix Zimmermann</p>
								<p>A little bit of sugar and a whole lotta sass, that’s what Alix is made of! A native New Yorker and pre-Portlandia transplant, Alix has been a part of the Urban Waxx family since 2009 and has brought the same level of cheer and enthusiasm to work with her ever since. She prides herself on making the waxing process as empowering, quick, and painless as is possible, leaving her guests smooth and smiling. Alix’s welcoming and wise-cracking demeanor quickly put even the most nervous newbies at ease. Behind the scenes she takes great pride in putting all of her skills to use as a Continuing Education Trainer for Estheticians at Urban Waxx. Away from work, Alix’s passions include Roller Derby, live music, exploring, glitter, and her beloved goofy dog Bonz. Alix has shifts at the Northwest and Division locations, so call today to let her put your waxing worries to rest!</p>

								<p>Leanna Inman</p>
								<p>Leanna is a Portland native, born and raised right here in the city of roses. She loves to backpack and camp with her husband Jeff (who she’s known since 7th grade!), and their Italian greyhounds, Ferrari and Porsche. Before becoming an esthetician, Leanna was a florist, but always had an obsession with beauty products and a passion for beautiful skin. She’s extremely detail oriented which comes in handy when getting down and dirty with those pesky little hairs. Leanna’s also a certified scuba diver, loves cold weather over hot and can give you a run for your money during a good ole’ fashioned game of darts! Looking to connect with Leanna?

								<p>Steph Blakeley</p>
								<p>This Sex and the City fanatic has seen every episode of every season approximately 8 times. She is an avid reader, loves cooking (paleo mostly), and loves to jam to R&amp;B and Hip Hop. So when you’re ready to get the perfect brow wax, Steph will have plenty to talk about- TV, Music, hiking, the best trending recipe, or the latest stats on Blake Griffin! Her favorite part of the job? Helping women feel confident and empowered!</p>

								<p>Jill Simmonds</p>
								<p>Jill loves to have an all around great time! She loves to laugh at stand up comedy and is even known to have several different belly laughs! And she was picked to be in an episode of the local web series “Vancouvria” (a spoof off of Portlandia). If that isn’t enough fun, Jill’s favorite activity sure is! She loves to have a dance party, even if she’s by herself- and especially when she’s cleaning the house. But she will show off her dance moves too, with karaoke of course. We are so delighted to have such an energetic new gal at Urban Waxx!</p>

							<img src="./stafffff_files/08_Gretchen_Mayfield_300x300.jpg">
							<div id="text">
								<p>Gretchen Mayfield</p>
								<p>Gretchen joined the UW team several years ago after moving here from Kansas City, MO.  We knew that she would be a perfect fit because Gretchen firmly believes that customer service is a lost art that needs to be found and cultivated (we could not agree more). This married lady is a masterful cook. In fact, secretly she would love to be a food critic. She longs to travel, all over Europe, but especially Italy. Madonna is a huge Madonna fan and firmly believes that she is the most fabulous woman that has ever walked the earth and she has always idolized her.  She loves burlesque and will get into the middle of any dance floor to shake, shimmy and show off! In her spare time she spends time as Sister Betti Crotcher with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, focusing on service, promoting human rights and respect for diversity and human enlightenment. </p>

								<p>Stephanie Byrne</p>
								<p>This Portland native (who has also lived in France!) is an outdoor girl. An avid hiker, a skier (since she was 3 years old), Stephanie loves the freedom of exploring new outdoor adventures. But as a resident of the rainy Pacific Northwest, Stephanie makes the most of her indoor time too. She loves cooking and baking (especially with avocados and chocolate), enjoys reading books and watching some good scary movies.</p>

								<p>Sara Pedrosa</p>
								<p>Originally from the east coast, this Baltimore, MD native is happy to now call the Pacific Northwest her home. Sara loves spending time outside, running and hiking with her friends, family and her dog Bodhi. When Sara isn’t here giving the best wax ever, there is a good chance you might find her in the kitchen, baking. In fact, she was a professional baker for 8 years prior to becoming an esthetician. Despite being a homebody at heart that loves a great home-cooked meal, listening to records, and a big bottle of wine, Sara’s also an extensive traveler. Next stop? Who knows!</p>

								<p>Mads Ambrose</p>
								<p>Mads is from Oklahoma. But this “Fashion Queen” loves to travel. Her favorite city is Istanbul, Turkey. She could swim on those shores forever! Mads loves to swim, and thinks she might have been a mermaid in a past life. Aside from swimming she loves trying any dish, at least once. She loves nature and camping. And she can sing every Beyonce song by heart. Mads fits right in at Urban Waxx and we are so happy to have her on our team!</p>

							<div id="text">
								<p>Carly Gerstlauer</p>
								<p>Need some make-up advice while you’re getting your monthly wax? Well, Carly is the gal for you. Her years as an Esthetician and make-up artist (2 with MAC Cosmetics), have honed her love of all things girly. When she’s not waxing she’s spending time with her husband, Gerdy, checking out the Portland food and drink scene. Her favorite: Tasty &amp; Sons. She also loves to cook at home for her husband Gerdy. Her other passions (besides waxing) decorating their apartment (and all things domestic), being an Auntie, Basketball (Go Blazers!) their cat Rudy, her hip hop dance class and of course MAKEUP!</p>

							<div id="text">
								<p>Rebecca France-Brush</p>
								<p>At first glance Rebecca appears to be rather serious, but she is actually a completely self-deprecating goofball. When she’s not ridding the Northwest of hair, she’s getting rowdy with her hilarious Westie, Desmond and her Australian Shepard, Oscar, and her husband Adam. Travel, great food and tasty cocktails are just a few things that Rebecca loves. If there was a movie made about her, we think Parker Posey with her quirky sense of humor would play her to a tee! She also loves fashion, and we are always commenting on how darling Rebecca looks whilst waxing!</p>

								<p>This aspiring country musician and banjo player is the pacific northwest version of a southern belle. Kerry, happily married and mom to Aurora (12) and Sailor (2), collects vintage slips, loves to entertain, spends endless hours at the grocery store - and is by far the best cook on the block. Like most PacNW locals she loves the rainy weather and lounging by the fire come fall and winter (hooray for lazy days!) while watching scary movies. Kerry also has a knack for making people laugh with her dry sense of humor, and this lady can really rock a jumpsuit!</p>

								<p>Claire Lundberg</p>
								<p>A hopeless romantic who’s been lucky to live her storybook ending for the past 15 years with her high school sweetie, Claire has lived in Oregon for most of her life and enjoys exploring the outdoors. She’s also not ashamed of being a complete and total bibliophile, in fact there might even be a bigger house in her future just to appease the out-of-control book habit that exists. Not to mention, when books are involved so is her other obsession, a hot cup of java! In addition to being a bookworm and coffee lush, Claire enjoys cooking, preserving, traveling, camping, and hiking. One of Claire’s passions is trying and discovering new makeup, skincare products and perfumes - rounding up her favorites, and sharing them with clients and friends.</p>

								<p>Lindsay Monroe</p>
								<p>Want to see this traveling gypsy melt? Ask her about Franklin Beans Badtouch her dog, and one of the great loves of her life. The other: Seth, her dreamboat husband that she married in an insane Las Vegas wedding. Lindsay is part of the Urban Waxx Training Team and also a Lead Waxxer. When she is not waxing the Portland population, she is getting tattoos that have no meaning (like a wolf-owl hybrid called a wowlve), taking over the karaoke scene with her George Michael or Kelly Clarkson renditions. She will always have a fondness for getting tattoos and wanting to start a band, but in the meantime she will settle on learning to play the drums.</p>

								<p>This Florida transplant (by way of Arizona), recently traded in the sunshine for the rolling hills of the Oregon wine country, where she lives with her husband David. When she’s not giving a fantastic Brazilian wax, she’s exploring the countryside with her golden retriever Biscuit, or snuggling up at home to her Siamese cat Ramses. She spends her spare time hiking and checking out local restaurants, and reading about her favorite topics: health and science. Her dream is to explore Europe and Egypt. No wonder her cat is named after an Egyptian pharaoh!</p>

She spends her free time tasting her way through town, venturing into new restaurants and scoping out really great wines. Prior to becoming one of Portland’s best waxers, she was a schoolteacher and has her bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Oregon State University - go BEAVS!

This nutty Olympian is hilarious, is excellent at impressions (ask her to sound like a Minnesotan) , and she is always making funny faces without even realizing it. Janelle is very superstitious (you MUST knock on wood only 3 times), and lady bugs are her good luck charms. She also loves famous quotes and sayings, and when she is not waxing she is laughing and/or dancing. Janelle will keep you cracking up the entire time she’s waxing you to perfection.</p>

								<p>Beth Kuriger-Peppe</p>
								<p>Beth (or Betty as she’s affectionately known) is our resident brow guru. Her background in graphic design and animation has helped her to perfect even the most unruly eyebrow into a well-sculpted arch. Don’t believe me? Check out her blog at bethbrows.blogspot.com. Beth’s dedication to excellence in the wax room has made her a fantastic addition as an Educator at the Urban Waxx Continuing Education Program. When she’s not waxing she’s zipping around town on her motorcycle, scooter, or bicycle with her husband Rich and shih-tzu Tootsie, in tow. These NJ transplants have really made a home for themselves here in Portland, and the proof can be found in their wonderful circle of friends and Beth’s loyal following of clientele.

Whether it’s heading to the local shopping center, coffee shop or new restaurant, Bailey is always keeping herself busy. She also loves all the music venue’s Portland has to offer, and she’s from sunny Southern California, so she of course loves short trips to the beach!</p>

Together they have two cuddly cats, Ninja and Mabo, and a puppy-dog named Junebug that they just can’t get enough of. Jenna delights in giving brow waxes that flatter each individual, making subtle differences for your overall look and showing off your beautiful peepers! She is also totally gung ho about making sure any wax you get is as painless and super smooth as possible -- just as you deserve! Jenna is available at the Division and NW locations. Call to make an appointment or book online with her for a great wax! </p>
