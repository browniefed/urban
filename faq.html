                    <div>
                        <h5>So, what is a Brazilian, anyway?</h5>
                        <p>A Brazilian waxx is the complete removal of the hair on the pubic region, the labia, and the butt crack. You do have the option, however, of either going completely bare or leaving a small landing strip or triangle of hair above the vaginal area.</p>

                        <h5>Why is the Brazilian $70 and the Brazilian Maintenance  only $50? What is a Maintenance, exactly?</h5>
                        <p>At Urban Waxx we have two prices for our most popular service. The Brazilian is what we charge any client that has never had a Brazilian wax at Urban Waxx. It doesn't matter if you have been waxed before, if you are new to us, then you are considered a Brazilian. However, when you reschedule within 6 weeks, then you are considered a Maintenance, and you will always be charged $50. We charge less for the Maintenance waxx because it is easier for both you and your waxxer, and it's a way to remind you to come back in on schedule!</p>

                        <h5>How long does the hair have to be to get waxed?</h5>
                        <p>We require that you have at least a 3 week hair growth. Honestly, the longer the better for your first waxx. It is VERY important to have enough hair growth when you come for your appointment. This allows the waxx to grab the hairs easily. If your hair is too short, we will ask you to reschedule your appointment.</p>

                        <h5>Do I have to be naked?</h5>
                        <p>No, not completely. But we will need you to undress from the waist down, including your underwear. I know it's a little unnerving for you, but trust me; we do these ALL day long. To us, it's all just skin and hair. So, please don't feel embarrassed. We will do our best to put you completely at ease!</p>

                        <h5>I have my period! Do I need to cancel?</h5>
                        <p>No! It doesn't bother us at all. Just use a tampon and we will work around the string. Honestly, it happens all the time!</p>

                        <h5>How often do I have to be waxxed?</h5>
                        <p>The baseline recommendation is every 4 weeks. That goes for everything: brows to legs to Brazilian. Some clients experience a slower or faster rate of hair growth, and that time can be changed accordingly. Your waxxer will help you gauge when you should return.</p>

                        <h5>What kind of waxx do you use?</h5>
                        <p>We use the absolute highest quality waxx available. For sensitive areas, such as the face, underarms, and bikini area, we use a hard waxx. A hard waxx melts at a lower temperature, is applied in a thicker layer, and is removed without a strip. The advantages of using a hard waxx is that we can go over the area multiple times without causing irritation, and it is excellent for delicate skin. For larger areas, like the legs and back, we use a high quality soft waxx, which is applied thinly and removed using pellon strips.</p>

                        <h5>Does waxxing cause ingrown hairs?</h5>
                        <p>Possibly. Some people get ingrown hairs no matter what type of depilation they choose. Exfoliating daily and using an ingrown eliminator that contains a combination of AHAs and BHAs, such as the amazing Serious Serum, can help this. It's the Urban Waxx favorite! We have a wide variety of exfoliants that we will happily recommend after your service.</p>

                        <h5>Will I be perfectly smooth after my first waxx?</h5>
                        <p>It's possible but not probable. Some clients are smooth as a baby's bottom after their first experience. However, it is common that after the first 2 or 3 waxings you may feel a wee bit of stubble. This occurs most frequently with clients that have coarse, dark hair, and it is most common with leg waxings. The reason for stubble is because your hair grows on 3 different cycles, each lasting about 28 days. It takes a few services for your hairs to all grow out long enough to be grabbed entirely by the waxx. When it does: smooth sailing!</p>

                        <h5>Will it make my hair grow back thicker?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely not. If that were the case, then wouldn't a bald man be able to waxx his head and grow hair? Waxxing does not cause you to grow more hair follicles. In fact, if you become a regular waxxer, you will notice that your hair will become quite sparse and not as coarse.</p>

                        <h5>Will it make my hair grow back darker?</h5>
                        <p>No. Waxxing will not change the pigment of your hair.</p>

                        <h5>How much does a Brazilian hurt? Seriously.</h5>
                        <p>Well, let's just say it doesn't feel great. But I think the worst part is the anticipation. Once your first time is over and you understand what to expect, it's a breeze. Plus, we always keep chatting to keep your mind off of the pain. Before you know it...you're done!</p>

                        <h5>What if I have a really low pain tolerance?</h5>
                        <p>We suggest taking a mild pain reliever like Aleve or Tylenol 30 minutes before your appointment. This can help to lessen any pain you may experience during your services.</p>

                        <h5>How long does it take to do a Brazilian?</h5>
                        <p>It all depends on the client. Usually 15-30 minutes. The first time is the longest, and then the monthly upkeep is much faster.</p>

                        <h5>Why should I waxx?</h5>
                        <p>Waxxed hair grows back smooth and fine, unlike the stubble that shaving causes. Each time you waxx, the hair follicle weakens and can eventually die, leaving you with less hair. Waxxing also lasts significantly longer than other epilation methods.</p>

                        <h5>Is waxxing sanitary? Can I get an STD?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely not. Waxx is antibacterial by nature. It is impossible to transfer anything during a waxx.</p>

                        <h5>Anything else I should know about waxxing?</h5>
                        <p>You should refrain from using waxxing as a hair-removal method if you are using Retin-A (currently or in the last 3 months), Acutance (currently or in the past 4 months), other keratolytic medications (that increase skin exfoliation), or are sunburned or recovering from a recent laser peel.</p>

                        <h5>What about the Male Brazilian?</h5>
                        <p>We remove all of the hair from the male bikini area, the scrotum, and the butt crack. This does not include the glutes, but we will happily add that to your service if you wish!</p>

                        <h5>Is waxxing scary?</h5>
                        <p>NO! It's fun! You'll love it! We promise! On top of that, we love what we do, and that enthusiasm is evident at Urban Waxx. Hearing: "That was so much better than I imagined," is very common after first time appointments. We also get a lot of hugs, laughter, and high-fives. Trust us, we do close to 20,000 Brazilians a year. We know what we are doing!</p>

                        <h5>I'm nervous! Can my partner/spouse/friend come into the appointment with me?</h5>
                        <p>Our policy at Urban Waxx is to allow one person in the treatment room at a time. We have found that this allows us to give the absolute best and most professional service available.</p>

                        <h5>Can I bring my child in the appointment with me?</h5>
                        <p>That is a completely personal decision. If you have a baby and they are comfortable in their car seat, or a child that can entertain themselves during your appointment, then absolutely. However, we truly want to focus on you during your appointment! Although we all love the little ones, sometimes a inquisitive child can get in the way of a smooth Brazilian or the perfect brow waxx.</p>

                        <h5>How important is it that I am on time for my appointment?</h5>
                        <p>It's important. We value our guest's time and we stay on schedule when it comes to our appointments. We are also usually fully booked. If a client is more than 5 minutes late for an appointment, we will usually have to reschedule. Although that may sound rigid, if we take a guest late, chances are we will be late for the next appointment. And for the one after that, and, well you get the idea. Additionally, we want you to have time to relax, and enjoy a beverage or a snack before your appointment. At Urban Waxx, it's all about the experience!</p>

                        <h5>What is your cancellation policy?</h5>
                        <p>Urban Waxx requires at least twelve hours notice to cancel or reschedule any appointment, and a credit card number is needed to hold your reservation. Please note that once an appointment is booked--unless we hear otherwise--we'll expect you to be here. 'Skipped' appointments will be charged 50% of the total service amount to the card number with which they were held.</p>
