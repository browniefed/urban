                            <p>Shannon is the founder and CEO of Urban Waxx. A New Jersey girl at heart, Shannon moved to Portland (by way of Charleston, SC and LA), in January 2007. After 10 years of working in spas and salons all around the country, she opened her dream business: a wax only salon with an over the top customer service philosophy. Shannon is also the creator and developer of Serious Serum.</p>

Sara loves spending time outside, running and hiking with her friends, family and her dog Bodhi. When Sara isn’t here giving the best wax ever, there is a good chance you might find her in the kitchen, baking. In fact, she was a professional baker for 8 years prior to becoming an esthetician. Despite being a homebody at heart that loves a great home-cooked meal, listening to records, and a big bottle of wine, Sara’s also an extensive traveler. Next stop? Who knows!</p>

Before becoming an esthetician, Leanna was a florist, but always had an obsession with beauty products and a passion for beautiful skin. She’s extremely detail oriented which comes in handy when getting down and dirty with those pesky little hairs. Leanna’s also a certified scuba diver, loves cold weather over hot and can give you a run for your money during a good ole’ fashioned game of darts! Looking to connect with Leanna?

The other: Seth, her dreamboat husband that she married in an insane Las Vegas wedding. Lindsay is part of the Urban Waxx Training Team and also a Lead Waxxer. When she is not waxing the Portland population, she is getting tattoos that have no meaning (like a wolf-owl hybrid called a wowlve), taking over the karaoke scene with her George Michael or Kelly Clarkson renditions. She will always have a fondness for getting tattoos and wanting to start a band, but in the meantime she will settle on learning to play the drums.</p>

When she’s not ridding the Northwest of hair, she’s getting rowdy with her hilarious Westie, Desmond and her Australian Shepard, Oscar, and her husband Adam. Travel, great food and tasty cocktails are just a few things that Rebecca loves. If there was a movie made about her, we think Parker Posey with her quirky sense of humor would play her to a tee! She also loves fashion, and we are always commenting on how darling Rebecca looks whilst waxing!</p>

                                <p>Beth (or Betty as she’s affectionately known) is our resident brow guru. Her background in graphic design and animation has helped her to perfect even the most unruly eyebrow into a well-sculpted arch. Don’t believe me? Check out her blog at bethbrows.blogspot.com. Beth’s dedication to excellence in the wax room has made her a fantastic addition as an Educator at the Urban Waxx Continuing Education Program. When she’s not waxing she’s zipping around town on her motorcycle, scooter, or bicycle with her husband Rich and shih-tzu Tootsie, in tow. These NJ transplants have really made a home for themselves here in Portland, and the proof can be found in their wonderful circle of friends and Beth’s loyal following of clientele.

This funny lady gets her goofy sense of humor from growing up on a steady diet of Benny Hill and Monty Python mixed in with some WWII History Channel programs. Meredith is a wine and fragrance enthusiast, and she collects funny printed leggings. In her spare time she snuggles with her incredibly bright mini Aussie names Angus. Meredith makes short work of putting even the most nervous guest at ease with her self deprecating wit and love of all things hilarious.</p>

When she’s not giving a fantastic Brazilian wax, she’s exploring the countryside with her golden retriever Biscuit, or snuggling up at home to her Siamese cat Ramses. She spends her spare time hiking and checking out local restaurants, and reading about her favorite topics: health and science. Her dream is to explore Europe and Egypt. No wonder her cat is named after an Egyptian pharaoh!</p>

She is also totally gung ho about making sure any wax you get is as painless and super smooth as possible -- just as you deserve! Jenna is available at the Division and NW locations.

                                <p>Gretchen joined the UW team several years ago after moving here from Kansas City, MO. We knew that she would be a perfect fit because Gretchen firmly believes that customer service is a lost art that needs to be found and cultivated (we could not agree more). This married lady is a masterful cook. In fact, secretly she would love to be a food critic. She longs to travel, all over Europe, but especially Italy. Madonna is a huge Madonna fan and firmly believes that she is the most fabulous woman that has ever walked the earth and she has always idolized her. She loves burlesque and will get into the middle of any dance floor to shake, shimmy and show off! In her spare time she spends time as Sister Betti Crotcher with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, focusing on service, promoting human rights and respect for diversity and human enlightenment. </p>

                                <p>Elizabeth was born and raised in Anchorage, AK. But her family is Columbian, and her favorite food is when her mom cooks up some traditional Colombian dishes. She has high hopes to master Columbian cooking one day! She has other aspirations too. Elizabeth loves to grab some tea (not coffee) and hit the books either studying Italian, or skin care since she is attending school for dermatology. When Elizabeth is not in the kitchen or the library, one of her favorite things to do is go to Red Light/House of Vintage on the East side of Portland. She just loves finding treasures!</p>

She has been a hairdresser for 3 years, and constantly strives to hone her skills. She moved to Portland from Park City, Utah where her obsession with giraffes and chocolate began. Kati may be slightly addicted to chocolate and anything with chocolate in it!</p>

Hadasse is also a retired gymnast and after a fabulous day of waxing, moonlights as a competitive gymnastics coach for Metro Gymnastics. She has a ferret named Binx, after the black cat in Hocus Pocus and her guilty pleasure is collecting coca cola paraphernalia.</p>
